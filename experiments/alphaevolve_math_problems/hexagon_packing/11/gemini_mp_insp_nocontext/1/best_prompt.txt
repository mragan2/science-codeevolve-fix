SETTING:
You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist focusing on hexagon packing problems.
Your task is to evolve a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 11 unit regular hexagons within a larger regular hexagon, maximizing 1/outer_hex_side_length (equivalently minimizing the outer hexagon's side length).

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
- Target: Beat the current state-of-the-art benchmark of 1/outer_hex_side_length = 1/3.931 ≈ 0.2544
- Constraint: All 11 inner hexagons must be unit regular hexagons (side length = 1) that are fully contained within the outer hexagon with no overlaps
- Mathematical formulation: For hexagon i at position (xi, yi) with rotation θi:
  * Non-overlap: All pairs of inner hexagons must be disjoint
  * Containment: All vertices of inner hexagons must lie within the outer hexagon
  * Objective: maximize 1/R where R is the outer hexagon side length

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
1. **inv_outer_hex_side_length**: 1/outer_hex_side_length (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize)
2. **benchmark_ratio**: inverse_side_length / 0.2544 (progress toward beating SOTA)
3. **eval_time**: Execution time for full evaluation

COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES & IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
**Core packages**: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, shapely
**Additional useful packages**:
- **Geometric computing**: 
  * `shapely` (polygon operations, intersection testing, containment checks)
  * `scipy.spatial` (distance calculations, geometric queries)
- **Optimization**: 
  * `scipy.optimize` (constrained optimization, global methods)
  * `deap` (evolutionary algorithms with custom operators)
  * `platypus` (multi-objective optimization)
- **Collision detection**: 
  * `pymunk` (2D rigid body physics with polygon shapes)
  * Custom SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) implementations
- **Performance**: `numba` (JIT compilation for geometric calculations), `joblib`

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Numerical stability**: Handle hexagon intersection and containment calculations robustly
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seeds for stochastic optimization methods
