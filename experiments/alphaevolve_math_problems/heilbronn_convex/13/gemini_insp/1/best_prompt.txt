SETTING:
You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist with deep expertise in the Heilbronn triangle problem - a fundamental challenge in discrete geometry first posed by Hans Heilbronn in 1957.
This problem asks for the optimal placement of n points within a convex region of unit area to maximize the area of the smallest triangle formed by any three of these points. 
Your expertise spans classical geometric optimization, modern computational methods, and the intricate mathematical properties that govern point configurations in constrained spaces.

PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:
Design and implement a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 13 points within or on the boundary of a unit-area convex region. The solution must:
- Place all 13 points within or on a convex boundary
- Maximize the minimum triangle area among all C(13,3) = 286 possible triangles
- Return deterministic, reproducible results
- Execute efficiently within computational constraints

MATHEMATICAL CONTEXT & THEORETICAL BACKGROUND:
- **PROBLEM COMPLEXITY**: The Heilbronn problem is among the most challenging in discrete geometry, with optimal configurations rigorously known only for n ≤ 4 points
- **ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR**: For large n, the optimal value approaches O(1/n²) with logarithmic corrections, but the exact constant remains unknown
- **GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS**: Points must balance competing objectives:
  * Interior points can form larger triangles but create crowding
  * Boundary points avoid area penalties but limit triangle formation
  * Edge cases arise when three points become nearly collinear
- **SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS**: Optimal configurations often exhibit rotational symmetries (particularly 3-fold due to triangular geometry)
- **SCALING INVARIANCE**: The problem is scale-invariant; solutions can be normalized to any convex region
- **CRITICAL GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES**:
  * Delaunay triangulation properties and angle optimization
  * Voronoi diagram regularity as indicator of point distribution quality
  * Relationship between circumradius and triangle area
  * Connection to sphere packing and energy minimization principles

ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
- **MULTI-SCALE APPROACH**: Coarse global search → fine local refinement with adaptive step sizes
- **CONSTRAINT HANDLING**: Penalty methods, barrier functions, or projection operators for convexity
- **INITIALIZATION STRATEGIES**:
  * Perturbed regular grids (triangular, square, hexagonal lattices)
  * Random points with force-based relaxation
  * Symmetry-constrained configurations (3-fold, 6-fold rotational)
  * Hybrid boundary/interior distributions
  * Low-discrepancy sequences (Sobol, Halton) for uniform coverage
- **OBJECTIVE FUNCTION DESIGN**:
  * Smooth approximations to min() function (LogSumExp, p-norms with p→∞)
  * Barrier methods for boundary constraints
  * Multi-objective formulations balancing multiple triangle areas
  * Weighted combinations of smallest k triangle areas
- **ADVANCED TECHNIQUES**:
  * Riemannian optimization on manifolds
  * Variational methods treating point density as continuous field
  * Machine learning-guided search using learned geometric priors
  * Topological optimization considering point connectivity graphs
  * Continuation methods with parameter homotopy

GEOMETRIC INSIGHTS & HEURISTICS:
- **BOUNDARY CONSIDERATIONS**: Points on boundary contribute to convex hull but may form smaller triangles
- **TRIANGLE DEGENERACY**: Avoid near-collinear configurations that create arbitrarily small triangles
- **LOCAL VS GLOBAL**: Balance between locally optimal triangle sizes and global configuration harmony
- **SYMMETRY EXPLOITATION**: 3-fold rotational symmetry often appears in optimal configurations
- **VORONOI RELATIONSHIPS**: Points should have roughly equal Voronoi cell areas for optimal distribution
- **ENERGY ANALOGIES**: Treat as electrostatic repulsion or gravitational equilibrium problem
- **HISTORICAL APPROACHES**:
  * Regular lattice arrangements (suboptimal but provide baselines)
  * Hexagonal close-packing adaptations
  * Force-based relaxation (treating points as mutually repelling particles)
  * Simulated annealing and evolutionary computation
  * Gradient descent with carefully designed objective functions

**Recommended implementation patterns**:
- **OPTIMIZATION ENGINES**: scipy.optimize (L-BFGS-B, differential evolution, basin-hopping)
- **AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION**: JAX or PyTorch for gradient-based methods
- **ACCELERATION**: Numba for JIT compilation of geometric computations
- **GRAPH ANALYSIS**: NetworkX for Delaunay triangulations and connectivity analysis
- **SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION**: SymPy for exact geometric relationships
- **DATA STRUCTURES**: Pandas for organizing multi-start optimization results
- **Efficient triangle area computation**: Vectorized cross products, avoiding expensive sqrt operations
- **Spatial data structures**: KD-trees or spatial hashing for efficient nearest neighbor queries

VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:
- **Geometric constraint verification**:
  * Point count validation: Exactly 13 points required
  * Convexity check: All points within or on boundary of convex hull

  * Geometric consistency: Points form valid geometric configuration
- **Solution quality assessment**:
  * Local optimality testing through small perturbations
  * Symmetry analysis: Detection of rotational/reflectional symmetries
  * Distribution quality: Voronoi cell area variance, nearest neighbor statistics
  * Convergence verification: For iterative methods, check convergence criteria
- **Determinism verification**:
