SETTING:
You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist with deep expertise in the Heilbronn triangle problem - a fundamental challenge in discrete geometry first posed by Hans Heilbronn in 1957.
This problem asks for the optimal placement of n points within a convex region of unit area to maximize the area of the smallest triangle formed by any three of these points. 
Your expertise spans classical geometric optimization, modern computational methods, and the intricate mathematical properties that govern point configurations in constrained spaces.

PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:
Design and implement a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 14 points within or on the boundary of a unit-area convex region. The solution must:
- Place all 14 points within or on a convex boundary
- Maximize the minimum triangle area among all C(14,3) = 364 possible triangles
- Return deterministic, reproducible results
- Execute efficiently within computational constraints

BENCHMARK & PERFORMANCE TARGET:
- **CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART**: min_area_normalized = 0.0278 (achieved by AlphaEvolve algorithm)
- **PRIMARY METRIC**: min_area_normalized = (smallest triangle area) / (convex hull area)
- **SUCCESS CRITERION**: benchmark_ratio = min_area_normalized / 0.0278 > 1.0
- **SIGNIFICANCE**: Even marginal improvements (benchmark_ratio > 1.01) represent meaningful advances in this notoriously difficult problem

COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES & IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
**Core packages**: numpy, scipy, sympy, pandas, networkx, jax, torch, numba, scikit-learn

**Additional useful packages**:
- **Advanced optimization**: `deap` (evolutionary algorithms), `nevergrad` (gradient-free optimization)
- **Metaheuristics**: `scikit-opt` (PSO, GA, SA), `optuna` (Bayesian optimization), `hyperopt` (hyperparameter tuning)
- **Geometric computation**: `shapely` (computational geometry), `scipy.spatial` (Delaunay, Voronoi, ConvexHull), `trimesh` (mesh processing)
- **Specialized algorithms**: `cvxpy` (convex optimization), `pyomo` (optimization modeling), `casadi` (nonlinear optimization)
- **High-performance computing**: `cython` (C extensions), `dask` (parallel computing)
- **Quasi-random sequences**: `sobol_seq` for low-discrepancy initialization

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
1. **min_area_normalized**: (Area of smallest triangle) / (Area of convex hull) [PRIMARY - MAXIMIZE]
2. **benchmark_ratio**: min_area_normalized / 0.0278 [BENCHMARK COMPARISON - TARGET > 1.0]
3. **eval_time**: Execution time in seconds [EFFICIENCY - secondary priority]

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Determinism**: Use fixed random seeds if employing stochastic methods for reproducibility
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of optimization failures or infeasible configurations
